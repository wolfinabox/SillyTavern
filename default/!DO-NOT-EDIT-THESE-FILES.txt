These are master copies of the default content files and are managed by SillyTavern.

Editing any of these files would not only have no effect, but will also cause merge conflicts during update pulls.

You should edit their respective copies instead, for example:

1. /default/config.yaml => /config.yaml
2. /default/public/css/user.css => /public/css/user.css
etc.
